Introduction



Game utilization has been rapidly gaining attention throughout the years, especially  with the Gen-Z, who are more technology driven.  
The quiz application our team has decided to implement is an educational quiz with  the focus on the subject of Accounting. Accounting is a vital part of financial  management and plays a critical role in helping businesses and individuals make  informed financial decisions.  
We have observed that not many people have grasped the concept of Accounting,  some view it as being too difficult or too tedious. In our quiz application, ‘Accounting Adventures’, you will have the opportunity to test your knowledge and learn  important Accounting concepts, principles, and practices in an interactive and fun  way. 
As you progress through the quiz application, you will be presented with a series of  trivia questions covering a diverse range of topics such as Financial statements,  Accounting equations, VAT, Inventory, Manufacturing, etc. Some questions will be  multiple choice or true and false, while others may require you to enter a numerical  answer. As you answer each question correctly you will earn points which will affect  your overall score for that particular level. You can also use lifelines to help you  answer questions that you may not be familiar with.  
Our quiz application consists of 3 levels, level 1 includes simple theory questions,  while with level 2 the difficulty increases by including questions on Accounting adjustments and equations, lastly is our 3rd level which is most challenging, as it  involves the user to enter a numerical answer pertaining to calculation type of  questions.  
Whether you are a learner studying Accounting at high school level, a business owner managing your finances, or simply someone interested in learning more  about this important field, this quiz application is an addictive and engaging way to  test your knowledge and build your skills.

Literature Review



Considering that we aim to present our project as an intuitive, interactive, and captivating  quiz application that trains/sharpens the mental capacity of school students that do  Accounting or any user who wants to learn more about this important subject – we have  collectively taken the time as a group to evaluate and assess other existing systems that  have similar characteristics. We decided to (assess) third-party reviews to avoid bias. We  extracted from user reviews the flaws/cons of existing systems and addressed how our quiz  application overcomes these shortfalls (considering that these users have interacted with  the respective existing systems). 
• Accounting Coach (https://www.accountingcoach.com) This is a web-based platform  that hosts Accounting courses which aid as learning material. It brings Accounting to  life by combining theory with real-world examples. The owner of the website uses  simple, clear and accurate explanations allowing people without Accounting  backgrounds to master Accounting concepts. 
“I liked Accounting Coach, personally. I used it along with Schaum's outlines. The  review crosswords were nice, and so was the different format. I found WGU's  book to be really boring, and trying to use it made the class take way longer than  it needed to.” 
~FierceProserpina, 2018 (Via Reddit) 
➢ Our quiz application will be designed to constantly grasp the attention  of the user. There will be animation/graphic based elements (pictures,  possibly video demonstrations, etc.). Implemented into the quiz  
application there will be an integrated ‘game’ that relates to Accounting  – the user will be able to enjoy the leisure of playing a game while at the  same time sharpen their Accounting skills. 
➢ We have noticed that the theory (learning material) is hard to read, its  placed in long paragraphs. With our quiz application we will use a very  simplistic approach that is easy to read which in turn, makes it easier for  the user to remember content. 
• Quizizz (https://quizizz.com) This is a web-based quiz platform that students can use  to test their knowledge on Accounting aspects. It offers multiple tools to make a  classroom for students fun, interactive and engaging. It can be used by teachers, to  help create lessons, conduct formative assessments, assign homework, and have  other interactions with students. 
“It is sometimes difficult for students to connect to a quiz and the cry of "I can't  get in" can be heard from them. The problem can usually be solved within a few  minutes' time.” 
~Giselda M., 2021 (Via GetApp)

“I hate that we can only unlock with a paid account. We have been asked to pay  for so much this year that I just can’t afford to keep dishing out money for  subscription even when they would benefit my students.” 
~Kristen T., 2020 (Via GetApp) 
➢ Our quiz application will be designed to be as user-friendly as possible  to eliminate confusion when navigating through the quiz application's  features. Functionality will be streamlined by means of an efficient use  of computation resources so that processing time may be minimized (no  lag). The cost to use the quiz application will be free of charge – there  are no “Pro Features” that may be accessed only by the user paying. We  understand that the quiz application is for use by students so everyone  is an equal and no one will be restricted access from content due to lack  of ability to pay for the quiz application or features of the quiz. No  student will be at a disadvantage this way. 
➢ By a glance the platform is very overwhelming, if a user is not used to  using a computer it can become difficult to navigate what is going on as  there’s no clear instructions and the background music is not very  pleasant. With our quiz application we would make it very user-friendly easy to navigate and not have background music but rather have sounds  when a button is clicked etc. 
• Accounting Quiz – AccQuiz (Android application on Google Playstore) AccQuiz is a  free accounting quiz and includes flash cards to study the quiz. It covers diverse  topics in financial accounting. It was developed by professional accountants and  have been verified for correctness.  
“Ads should only pop out before or after taking the quiz, not during the entire  duration!” 
~Reid Chrysler Manares, 2023 (Via Google Playstore) 
“It has a lot of spelling and grammatical errors. And you can't adjust the size of  the font, which I think is too big. Plus when you exit the app, your progress will  be lost and you would have to start all over again” 
~Naruto Ronaldo, 2020 (Via Google Playstore) 
“Idea is nice, but some questions are repetitive.” 
~Wisdom Chilufya, 2020 (Via Google Playstore)

➢ To address the advert catastrophe, our group has no sponsor hence no  sponsored content will be hosted or advertised in our program. As a  group, we understand that uninterrupted bandwidth may be difficult to  come across in South Africa – for this reason, we have decided that our  quiz application will not be web based to prevent the issue of slow  
loading time (or denial of server access). The quiz application will run on  the users’ local machine and utilize processing power of the local CPU.  When composing the questions for our broad database that would  
serve as a bank of questions – all group members will oversee grammar  used in the questions so that punctuation and grammatical errors may  be reduced. We would make use of secondary storage (permanent  
storage) so that we can restore a users’ progress if they wish to leave a  quiz halfway and continue later.  
➢ The quizzes graphical interface is very basic, it does not lure users to  want to use it. It only makes use of 3 colours, green, white, and black.  Our quiz application will be more interactive with the use of animations and fun graphics. We would also use more colours that will make the  quiz application’s user interface more appealing and attractive to the  user. 
Side Notes 
• Some systems have restricted access to content due to pro features (paid) • Some systems are based online (require stable internet connection) 
Research relating to Game engines and Graphics libraries. 
Firstly, let us define what a Game engine and Graphics Library is. 
• “A game engine is a set of software tools that optimizes the development of  video games. These engines can be small and minimalist, providing just a game  loop and a couple of rendering functions, or be large and comprehensive, similar  to IDE-like applications where developers can script, debug, customize level logic,  AI, design, publish, collaborate, and ultimately build a game from start to finish  without the need to ever leave the engine.” [game.developer.com] 
• “A graphics library is a program library designed to aid in rendering computer  graphics to a monitor. This typically involves providing optimized versions of  functions that handle common rendering tasks. This can be done purely in  software and running on the CPU, common in embedded systems, or being  hardware accelerated by a GPU, more common in PCs. By employing these  functions, a program can assemble an image to be output to a monitor. This  relieves the programmer of the task of creating and optimizing these functions,  and allows them to focus on building the graphics program. Graphics libraries are  mainly used in video games and simulations.” [en.wikipedia.org]

Here are some examples of Game engines and frameworks: 
• Unreal Engine 
“Unreal Engine is a professional suite of tools and technologies used for building  high-quality games across a range of platforms. Unreal Engine’s rendering  architecture enables developers to achieve stunning visuals and also scale elegantly  to lower-end systems. 
Revolutionary new workflow features and a deep toolset empower developers to  quickly iterate on ideas and see immediate results, while complete C++ source code  access brings the experience to a whole new level. 
Unreal Engine technology powers hundreds of games as well as real-time 3D films,  training simulations, visualizations and more. Over the past 15 years, thousands of  individuals and teams and have built careers and companies around skills developed  using the engine.” [alternativeto.net] 
• SFML 
“SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) is a portable and easy-to-use API for  multimedia programming. 
It is written in C++ with bindings available for C, D, Python, Ruby, OCaml, .Net and  Go. It can be thought of as an object oriented alternative to SDL. 
SFML provides hardware accelerated 2D graphics using OpenGL, supports OpenGL  windowing and provides different modules that ease multimedia and game  programming. SFML site offers complete SDK bundle in single pack, and tutorials to  ease the developers. SFML Source code is provided under the terms of the zlib/png  license.” [alternativeto.net] 
• Unity 
“The Unity game engine has been in use since 2005 and is now a mainstay of the  independent game market. This game engine is frequently updated and suitable for  both 2D and 3D games of all kinds. In addition, many businesses and programmers  have created handy SDKs for the engine, making it a well-liked option for interactive  virtual game development and augmented reality development. Additionally, Unity has a sizable user base and an accessible Asset Store including both free and paid  assets. It is an excellent option for beginners irrespective of what they wish to create  because it is such a powerful engine and independent for game developers.”  [blog.digitalogy.co]

Objectives



• To create a captivating and interactive quiz application that revamps the tedious  process of knowledge acquisition and assessment into an enjoyable and fulfilling  experience. 
• To design the application using a high-level language C++ to devise and execute a  code that guarantees swift and seamless runtime performance for the software  while curbing resource consumption, resulting in an elevated degree of code  efficiency. 
• To feature visually appealing and user-friendly Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)  designed using Microsoft Visual Studio. The GUIs will be straightforward and  intuitive, while also providing the user with a help function on each screen to  mitigate confusion and streamline navigation. 
• To have robust error handling mechanisms to prevent the application from crashing  and to ensure seamless user experience. 
• Providing the user with incentives and challenges to keep them stimulated and  encourage them to keep engaging with the content. 
• The user will be asked questions in different formats , such as multiple choice ,  true/false and others, to avoid monotony and keep the users interested. 
• To facilitate gradual knowledge acquisition, the application will feature three levels  of difficulty that gradually increase in complexity as the quiz progresses, building the  user's confidence and broadening their knowledge base. 
• To enhance the user experience by providing lifelines which serve as hints of the  correct answer to help the user when in doubt. This will motivate the user to keep  trying to answer and potentially help increase their overall score. 
• To include sound effects to certain aspects of the quiz application allowing the user to feel different emotions during certain situations, improving the overall experience of the quiz application. 
• The user will be able to view their scores on a leaderboard and see how they rank  amongst other players. This will motivate users to play more regularly, which in turn  will increase their cognitive abilities in an exciting way.

Methodology



Once a user executes the quiz application – they will be greeted by an innovative login  screen. As a group, we would make use of a class for the login screen. The intelligent login  screen would prompt the user to login with their account details (a user must have a user  account to access and interact with the quiz application).  
• If the user does not have account login details (first time user) there is a “Not a  registered user?” option on the login screen. By selecting this option, the user is  transferred to another form/screen/interface in the quiz application. This form  allows for the application to capture the user’s details so that it can add the user to  an already existing database of players. The user would then be able to login as a  registered user of the quiz application. 
• If the user does have their login details (i.e., a registered user of the quiz application)  they would be expected to possess the capacity to enter these details into the  relevant fields displayed before them via the keyboard. Once they click on the ‘Login’  button, the quiz application will then sift through the database of registered users  and compare the combination entered from the application’s login screen to a  combination of username and passwords in the database. If there isn’t a match, the  user will be informed that their login is unsuccessful. If there is a match, the user will  be identified by the quiz application, informed that their login attempt was  successful, welcomed back and then transferred to the “Quiz” platform which is a  combination of interfaces that allow for the user to take the quiz.  
• There will also be another login option implemented that would allow for the admin  to login. The administrator of the quiz application is usually a single user (unlike  multiple registered application users). The admin may even be the owner of the quiz  application and oversees the administration of the application. The administrator  would be in charge of maintaining the quiz application (ensuring that the user  database is not overpopulated by removing inactive users etc.) The admin form  would be implemented via a class. The login details for the admin may be hard  coded into the quiz application’s implementation rather than being stored in third  party/secondary storage such as a database. 
Once a user’s login is successful, they would be transferred to the quiz platform as stated  above. We would use visual studio to implement graphical components of the quiz application and game. The quiz application would be implemented via a class. There will be  three levels of questioning that would be used as means of testing the user in the quiz  platform.  
• The first level is the easiest level of the quiz and is meant to ease the user into the  kind of questioning (in terms of choice of words, grammar etc.) expected throughout  the duration of the quiz. It consists of 10 true or false questions that test basic  Accounting theory. There would be 4 different variations of these questions. 
9 
• The second level is the intermediate phase of the quiz. The grade of questioning is  more difficult. It consists of 10 multiple choice questions and there are 3 different  variants of questioning.  
• The third and final level of the quiz is the most difficult. Our complex questions that  would really test the user will be implemented here. Questions would be presented  with a scenario and the user may be prompted to input numeric responses via a  textbox.  
• After the quiz has been completed by the user, the leaderboard that we would  implement as a group would be displayed to the user. The leaderboard shows the  scores and possibly time it took other users to complete similar Accounting  questions. The leaderboard would also show where the current user ranks on the  leaderboard.  
As an additional feature, we will implement a game element to keep the user entertained as  well as keep the user on top of their game. We will do this by implementing a grading  system for the user’s performance. The rating would be based on a 5-star performance.  Each star represents 20% therefore if a user obtains a 5-star rating, it means that they have  answered 100% of the level’s questions correctly. The game would be accessible to a user if  they obtain 4 stars and above (80% of questions correct) 
• The game for the first level is an Accounting related puzzle. 
• The game for the second level is a card matching OR crossword game with an  Accounting theme.  
• The game for the third level is hangman with some of the more difficult Accounting  terms.
